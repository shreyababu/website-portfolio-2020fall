      <p id='term'>The term “genocide” was first coined by Raphäel Lemkin, a Polish Lawyer, in 1944. This was both in response to the Holocaust and prior instances of systematic murders against a targeted group. Lemkin led the campaign to have genocide recognized as an international crime; it was first recognized as such by the United Nations General Assembly in 1946.</p>
