      <p id= 'past'>Though the Rwandan Genocide took place over 25 years ago, genocide is not a thing of the past.</p>

        <h2>Darfur, Sudan (2003-present)</h2>
        <p>The most recent genocide in Darfur began in 2003, when the Sudanese government and Arab militias (Janjaweed) destroyed over 400 villages, allegedly in response to two opposition groups: the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). The genocide in Darfur has killed at least 450,000 people since 2003.</p>
        <p>In April 2003, when the rebel groups attacked the military airfield and kidnapped an air force general, the government launched a counterattack. It led to a response from the Khartoum government where they armed militia forces to eliminate the rebellion. This resulted in mass violence against the citizens in Darfur.</p>

        <h2>Yemen (2011-present)</h2>
        <p>Genocide Watch has issued a Genocide Emergency for Yemen. The Armed Conflict Location & Data Project (ACLED) reports that more than 100,000 Yemenis have died since the beginning of the conflict in 2015. More than 12,000 of those were killed by directly targeted attacks, including 7,500 children.</p>
        <p>In addition, 20 million Yemenis have insufficient food, with ten million on the brink of starvation. Young children are dying by the thousands, and over two million are in need of treatment for severe acute malnutrition. Yemen is experiencing the world’s largest cholera epidemic.</p>

        <h2>Uighurs (China)</h2>
        <p>The Uighurs are a minority Turkish Muslim ethnic group originating from northwestern China, specifically the Xinjiang region. There are about 11 million members of this group living in China. But since 2017, it has been widely reported that the Chinese government has detained around 1 million Uighurs in detainment camps that they are calling “political education” or “vocational training” centers, according to the Human Rights Watch.</p>
        <p> As of October 2020, US senators have sought to declare that China is committing genocide against Uighurs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims.</p>

        <h2>Myanmar (2016-present)</h2>
        <p>A series of ongoing persecutions by the Myanmar (formerly Burmese) government against the Muslim Rohingya people. The genocide has consisted of two phases to date: the first occurred from October 2016 to January 2017 and the second has been occurring since August 2017.</p>
        <p>Since August 2017, the Myanmar armed forces have pursued an accelerated policy of genocide towards the Rohingya, ostensibly in retaliation for an attack on Myanmar security forces by a Rohingya insurgent group that killed a dozen soldiers.</p>
